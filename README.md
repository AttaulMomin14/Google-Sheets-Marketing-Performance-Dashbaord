# Google-Sheets-Marketing-Performance-Dashbaord
I developed a Marketing Dashboard in Google Sheets, designed to provide insights into performance and partner metrics. The dashboard was fully dynamic &amp; interactive, offering users the ability to analyze key metrics through dropdowns &amp; summary tables, with data displayed based on user selection.

**Project Description:**

This project involved the creation of a powerful and flexible Marketing Reporting Dashboard Summary Builder in Google Sheets. The dashboard was split into two main sections: a Performance Metrics dashboard and a Partners Metrics Dashboard.

For the Performance Metrics dashboard, I tracked vital KPIs such as Total Clicks, Free Signups, Paid Signups, Average Order Value, Total Transactions, Customer Acquisition Cost, and Total Revenue. The dashboard's interactive design included dropdowns that allowed users to select specific metrics, which were then dynamically displayed in charts. Additionally, I implemented a summary table that could present data for a selected year, offering a high-level view of monthly and quarterly performance.

The Partners Metrics Dashboard focused on metrics related to partners, including the number of Partners, Partners Logged In, Partners with Free Signups, and Partners with Paid Signups. This section also featured interactive elements, enabling users to filter and analyze partner performance data effectively.

This project showcases my ability to create user-friendly, data-driven dashboards in Google Sheets, transforming raw data into actionable insights for marketing and partner performance tracking.
